Project for "Android's smartphone apps" course in HIT.

In this project I built a hybrid Android app to save and display data of your GYM exercises.
The main tools Iâ€™ve used for this project are as follows:

IDE: Android Studio (version 3.2.1)
DB: Android's SQLite
Languages:
- In the webview - HTML, CSS and Javascript
- JAVA for native code (Views, Resources etc.)

Libraries used in the project: JQM, C3.JS (Charts).
